- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production in the `build` folder. The app is now optimized for the best performance.

- `npm test`: Initiates the test runner for running unit tests included in the project.

- `npm run eject`: **Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!** This command allows you to eject the project and customize the build configuration if necessary.

Remember to use these scripts with caution and refer to the official React documentation for more details.
